# Introduction

The Sequence Unity Embedded Wallet SDK provides full Sequence [Embedded Wallet](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/overview) and [Indexer](/api/indexer/overview) integration for your Unity Games, integrated with our own purpose-built for Unity SequenceEthereum library. That's right, no Nethereum required!

This SDK follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`major.minor.patch`). While we're still in `0.x.y` builds, API breaking changes can be made at any time. After `1.0.0`, breaking changes will always cause a `major` version increment, non-breaking new features will cause a `minor` version increment, and bugfixes will cause a `patch` version increment.

## Requirements

Unity 2021.3.6f1 or later

- Android
- iOS
- PC standalone
- Mac standalone -> (Mono builds only when using Social Sign in -> in our testing MacOS doesn't pick up custom URL schemes automatically unless you run some system commands first; these system commands only work on Mono -> see [OpenIdAuthentication.PlatformSpecificSetup](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence-unity/blob/master/Assets/SequenceSDK/Authentication/OpenIdAuthenticator.cs#L89))
- WebGL (excluding Social Sign in)

## Integration Video

While a video will never be a full substitute for documentation, we've created a 20 minute video demonstrating the integration process and explaning some of the steps and thought process behind them which you may find helpful. Watch it on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/iNIeZKEscN8
