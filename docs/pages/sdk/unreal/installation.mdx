# Installation

## Configuration Key Management

Before you can use the Sequence Unreal SDK, you need to acquire the following configuration keys from the Sequence Builder:

- `WaaSConfigKey`: This key can be learned about [here](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet)
- `ProjectAccessKey`: This key can be learned about [here](/solutions/builder/getting-started#claim-an-api-access-key)

You can then add these credentials in the `SequenceConfig.ini` file under `[YourProject]/Config/SequenceConfig.ini`.

## Security

You must provide a 32 character encryption key in the **[SequenceConfig.ini]** file under [YourProject]/Config/SequenceConfig.ini
under the config variable `FallbackEncryptionKey`.

In order to prevent tampering with data you must encrypt your packaged project using Unreals packaging settings. You can refer to [these docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/packaging-unreal-engine-projects?application_version=5.3) for more information.
