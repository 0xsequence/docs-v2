# Installation

## Credentials

Before you can use this plugin, you need to acquire the following credentials from [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build):

    b) `WaaS Config Key` - You can get this key in [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/) under `Wallets > Embedded Wallet` once your configuration is setup.

    c) `Project Access Keys` - These are found in the [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/) under `Wallets > Embedded Wallet` as well.

You can then add these credentials in the `[Config.h]` file under `SequencePlugin/Source/SequencePlugin/Private/Config/Config.h`.

## Security

You must provide an encryption key implementation at `[SequenceEncryptor.cpp]` function `[GetStoredKey]`. This function must be implemented to provide a securely stored private key that will be used to encrypt and decrypt client information. Failure to do so will result in NO information being stored or in the event you do not use a securely stored key, can result in client information being stored insecurely on their systems.
