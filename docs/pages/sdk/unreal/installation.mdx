# Installation

## Credentials

Before you can use this plugin, you need to acquire the following credentials from [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.xyz/builder)

- `WaaS Configuration Key`
- `Project Access Key`

You can then add these credentials in the **[SequenceConfig.ini]** file under [YourProject]/Config/SequenceConfig.ini

## Security

You must provide a 32 character encryption key in the **[SequenceConfig.ini]** file under [YourProject]/Config/SequenceConfig.ini
under the config variable `FallbackEncryptionKey`.

In order to prevent tampering with data you must encrypt your packaged project using Unreals packaging settings. You can refer to [these docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/packaging-unreal-engine-projects?application_version=5.3) for more information.
