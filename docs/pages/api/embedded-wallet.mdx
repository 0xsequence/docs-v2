# Embedded Wallet API

<Callout type="note">API Documentation Coming Soon</Callout>

Sequence Embedded Wallet (or Wallet-as-a-Service) enables the creation, management and usage of fully functional EVM compatible wallets. These wallets can be created on-demand for each user and allow you to integrate an application with an Ethereum compatible blockchain, while using familiar constructions like RPC APIs.

Sequence Embedded Wallet offers real non-custodial wallets and the system guarantees that each created wallet can only be accessed with the consent of the owner of the wallet.
