## Getting Started

### SDK Installation

We provide TypeScript and Unity SDKs for the In-Game Wallet authentication system. You can install the TypeScript SDK with:

```bash
pnpm install @0xsequence/waas
```

For more information on the Unity In-Game Wallet SDK, please refer to the TODO add link [Unity SDK documentation](#TODO)

### Project Setup

Sequence In-Game Wallet is currently only available as a closed beta. To start using the In-Game Wallet SDKs, you'll need to contact the Sequence team and acquire API credentials. Once this is done, you will be provided with two keys:

- Project access key
- In-Game Wallet configuration key

### Library Setup

To start using Sequence In-Game Wallet SDK, you'll need to create a new instance of the `waas` class:

```typescript
import { SequenceWaaS } from '@0xsequence/waas'

const waas = new SequenceWaaS({
  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,
  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,
  network: 'mumbai'
}, defaults.TEST)
```

Note that the library is operational, but it can't be used to interact with any wallet until you have authenticated **as a user**.
