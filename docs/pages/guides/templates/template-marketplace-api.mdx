# Custom Marketplace

In this guide we will go through the process of creating a custom marketplace from a few simple tools from the Sequence stack.

The tools will enable you to perform:

- [Minting](/guides/templates/template-marketplace-api#minting): Minting of tokens to your wallet from the Sequence Builder
- [Blockchain Queries](/guides/templates/template-marketplace-api#blockchain-queries): Querying of token balances using the Indexer
- [Request Creation](/guides/templates/template-marketplace-api#request-creation): Creation of sell listing requests on the Sequence Market Protocol
- [Order Accepting](/guides/templates/template-marketplace-api#order-accepting): Accepting of top orders from the Marketplace

All of this in custom javascript code

## Minting

The first step is to create a collectible from the sequence Builder with a few mints, which can be accomplished with this [guide](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/01-deploy-an-item-collection).

## Blockchain Queries

Once you have one or a few collectibles minted, you can query the data from the contract address from your deployment, which can be found here:

![copy contract address](/img/marketplace/copy_contract.png)

You can query data using the indexer, using this code where an account address and contract address are inputted into the indexer api

```js
// Works in both a Webapp (browser) or Node.js:
import { SequenceIndexer } from "@0xsequence/indexer";

const indexer = new SequenceIndexer(
  "https://arbitrum-sepolia-indexer.sequence.app",
  "<access-key>"
);

// try any contract and account address you'd like :), as an example
const contractAddress = "0x1693ffc74edbb50d6138517fe5cd64fd1c917709";
const accountAddress = "0xc2be9cf6d9ee4fd211f88620760e829792659b16";

// query Sequence Indexer for all nft balances of the account on Polygon
const nftBalances = await indexer.getTokenBalances({
  contractAddress: contractAddress,
  accountAddress: accountAddress,
  includeMetadata: true,
});

console.log("collection of items:", nftBalances);
```

Where the response of the indexer call, yields the follow data:
