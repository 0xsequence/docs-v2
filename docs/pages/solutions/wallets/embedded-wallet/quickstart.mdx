# Quickstart

There are several ways to try out a Sequence Embedded Wallet integration before doing a complete configuration specific to your application. 

**Demo and Games:**
- [Sequence WaaS demo](https://waas-demo.sequence.xyz/): Experience a sample authentication and transaction flow using the Sequence Kit for web applications.
- [Aviator](https://0xsequence.github.io/waas-airplane-demo/): Explore a WebGL game that integrates the Embedded Wallet with the [Sequence Marketplace API](/solutions/marketplaces/orderbook/overview) as well as [serverless Cloudflare Worker](/guides/mint-collectibles-serverless) for minting
- [Jelly Forest](https://github.com/0xsequence-demos/jelly-forest): Check out the source code for our Unity WaaS SDK demo, compatible with iOS and Android.

**Test Configuration Keys:**
Use a provided Project Access Key and WaaS Configuration Key for testing in your application. These keys are configured for testing with Google and Apple and are restricted to localhost.
- Project Access Key: `AQAAAAAAAEGvyZiWA9FMslYeG_yayXaHnSI`
- WaaS Configuration Key: `eyJwcm9qZWN0SWQiOjE2ODE1LCJycGNTZXJ2ZXIiOiJodHRwczovL3dhYXMuc2VxdWVuY2UuYXBwIn0=`

**Integration and SDK Guides:**
- View integration steps in the Demo WaaS repository.
- Access SDK-specific guides for TypeScript, Unity, and Unreal.

When you're ready for full integration, follow the Builder guide to configure your own Embedded Wallet.


To see how to integrate these keys into a sample demo application, you can browse the [Demo WaaS repository](https://github.com/0xsequence/demo-waas-auth).

You can also view SDK-specific guides here:

- [TypeScript SDK](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/quickstart)
- [Unity SDK](/sdk/unity/overview)
- [Unreal SDK](/sdk/unreal/overview)

When you are ready to configure your own Embedded Wallet, you can [follow the Builder guide here](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet).

## Getting Started with TypeScript SDK

::::steps

### SDK Installation
You can install the TypeScript SDK with:

```bash
pnpm install @0xsequence/waas
```

### Project Setup
est the library with the provided Project Access Key and WaaS Configuration Key. Ready for full configuration? Follow [the Builder guide here](/solutions/builder/embedded-wallet).

### Library Setup
Start by creating a new instance of the waas class:

```typescript
import { SequenceWaaS } from '@0xsequence/waas'

const waas = new SequenceWaaS({
  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,
  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,
  network: 'arbitrum-nova'
})
```
::::

Note: The library is operational; however, you must authenticate **as a user** before you can interact with any wallet.
