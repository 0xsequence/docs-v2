# On-ramp
Since the Embedded Wallet product can be integrated with [Sequence Kit](/solutions/wallets/sequence-kit/overview) (a guide on this [here](/guides/custom-marketplace#7-optional-integrate-embedded-wallet-into-sequence-kit)), a developer can allow their users to purchase fiat via a credit or debit card with the use of a simplified react component.

Integration steps can be found [here](/solutions/wallets/sequence-kit/on-ramp)
