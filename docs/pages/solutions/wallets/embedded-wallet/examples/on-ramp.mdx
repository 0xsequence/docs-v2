# On-ramp

Since the Embedded Wallet product can be integrated with [Sequence Kit](/sdk/sequence-kit/overview) (a guide on this [here](/guides/custom-marketplace#7-optional-integrate-embedded-wallet-into-sequence-kit)), a developer can enable their users to purchase crypto with fiat via a credit or debit card.

Integration steps can be found [here](/sdk/sequence-kit/on-ramp).
