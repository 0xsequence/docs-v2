# Verification

In the event that you need to verify the ownership of an Embedded Wallet address, the following example can be used to prove ownership, with the help of an off-chain store of wallet nonces.
 
## Example: Server Address Ownership Verification

::::steps

### Generate & Store Random Nonce

On the server or decentralized compute, generate a random nonce, store it in a database, and return the nonce to the client when needed.

Example code in Typescript using `ethers@5.7.2`

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers'
...
const randomNonce = ethers.BigNumber.from(
  ethers.utils.hexlify(ethers.utils.randomBytes(20))
)

// store randomNonce in a database
```

### Client calls `sessionAuthProof`

The client requests the `nonce` and runs

```typescript
import { SequenceWaaS } from '@0xsequence/waas'
 
const sequence = new SequenceWaaS({
  projectAccessKey: `${process.env.PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY}`,
  waasConfigKey: `${process.env.WAAS_CONFIG_KEY}`,
  network: 'arbitrum-nova'
})

... obtain nonce from database
const authProof = sequence.sessionAuthProof({ nonce }) 
```

### Transmittance of Signature to Server

Next, send the `authProof` to the server

### Server Verification
