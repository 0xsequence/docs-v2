# Sequence Embedded Wallet

Sequence Embedded Wallet enables the creation, management and usage of fully functional EVM compatible wallets that can be easily integrated into your game or experience through our various SDKs such as [TypeScript](/solutions/wallets/embedded-wallet/quickstart), [Unity](/sdk/unity/overview) and [Unreal](/sdk/unreal/overview).

**Simplified User Experience:** Our headless wallets are created on-demand for each user. Integrate with Ethereum-compatible blockchains using familiar RPC APIs, without any disruptive pop-up modals or user-facing confirmations. This ensures a native and uninterrupted gaming experience.

**Security and Ownership:** Sequence Embedded Wallet provides real non-custodial wallets. Every wallet is guaranteed secure, accessible only with the owner's consent. This security is enforced through the innovative use of AWS Nitro Enclaves [AWS Nitro Enclaves](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/), ensuring that sensitive data is managed in a highly secure environment, inaccessible even to Sequence.
