# Sequence Wallets Overview

Sequence provides tools for developers to build games and blockchain apps that users love. We focus on smooth gaming, advanced web3 functions, and compatibility with all blockchain accounts. We offer three main tools: The Embedded Wallet, the Universal Wallet, and SequenceKit. These integrate with popular game engines like Unreal and Unity; with established blockchain wallets like MetaMask; and all use Typescript for easy error handling and speed.

- Game developers use the Embedded Wallet to give players immediate game access with accounts on demand, and logins via social platforms, phone, or email.  Your users can enjoy games without worrying about the blockchain.
- Blockchain application developers use the Universal Wallet for more advanced controls and out of game experiences for their users across the Ethereum ecosystem.
- SequenceKit [SequenceKit](/sdk/sequence-kit/overview) combines the features of both the Embedded and Universal Wallets into a customizable UI. You can attract a broader user base by accommodating users with pre-existing wallets and those who prefer the convenience of social logins. The [Typescript SDK](/sdk/typescript/guides/overview) makes integration straightforward.

# **Understand Account Types**
**Accounts (Offchain):**
In the current web model, users create online accounts to access services by providing personal data. They secure these accounts with keys and passwords. The accounts store user data and follow specific rules. The security of the data depends on the offchain account provider.

**Onchain Accounts - Externally-Owned Accounts (EOA):**
EOAs on the Ethereum blockchain are controlled by private keys held by the user. These accounts facilitate transactions and interact with applications without needing on-chain deployment. They require ETH for transaction fees, and the security depends solely on private key management.

**Onchain Accounts - Smart Accounts:**
Smart accounts are based on smart contract code that needs deployment to the blockchain. These accounts offer advanced features like transaction batching and multi-signature management and can use various tokens for gas fees.

**Onchain Accounts - Embedded Smart Accounts:**
Embedded in specific dApps, these smart contract accounts streamline the setup process, allowing direct wallet actions within the dApp.  Access is confined to the dApp, simplifying use for newcomers to blockchain.
