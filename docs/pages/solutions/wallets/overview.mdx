# Sequence Wallets Overview

Sequence offers multiple wallet options to integrate into your products, chiefly we call these our **Embedded Wallet** and our **Universal Wallet** which are both completely non-custodial.

### What are the differences between these options?

The **Embedded Wallet** is primarily focused on delivering a traditional game experience that is headless with no mandatory pop-ups, modals, transaction signing, or other additional distractions take players out of them trying to enjoy the game. Users can login with common social logins or other authentication providers and simply jump into the experience. We provide native support for a variety of popular game engines such as Unreal and Unity as well as Typescript support so you can stay within your preferred framework for building games or experiences.

Conversely, our **Universal Wallet** is geared more towards native blockchain users with a focus on games and gaming assets. Existing blockchain users will feel right at home where you can leverage our wallet infrastructure for creating great experiences for web3 users, complete with a Typescript SDK for easy integration.

### What are the benefits of each and how can I leverage them?
All integrations provide non-custodial smart contract wallets with account abstraction advantages like optionality for gasless transactions. We recommend our **Embedded Wallet** if you are focused on a seamless, headless web2/2.5-like experience for your players or our **Universal Wallet** for prioritizing web2.5/web3 native users.

Best of all, our wallet connector called [SequenceKit](/sdk/sequence-kit/01-overview) integrates both options in a convenient, customizable UI written in Typescript, which you can leverage to cater to users with an existing wallet such as Metamask and millions of potential new users that want the convenience of social login.
