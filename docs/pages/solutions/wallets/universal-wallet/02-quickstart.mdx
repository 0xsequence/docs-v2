## Install for existing project

We provide TypeScript and Unity SDKs for the Embedded Wallet authentication system. You can install the TypeScript SDK with:

```bash
pnpm install @0xsequence/waas
```

For more information on the Unity Embedded Wallet SDK, please refer to the [Unity SDK documentation](/unity-waas-sdk).

The sequence.js SDK is composed of several sub-packages combined into a single meta-package called `0xsequence`.
To add the SDK to your project, add a dependency on 0xsequence to your package.json:

```sh
npm install 0xsequence ethers
```
or

```sh
pnpm install 0xsequence ethers
```
or

```sh
yarn add 0xsequence ethers
```

If you know that your project only requires specific sub-packages, you can also depend on those directly with
`npm add @0xsequence/<sub-package name>`.

Your package.json should look something like this (actual version may vary):
```json
{
  "name": "my-dapp",
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "0xsequence": "^1.0.0",
    "ethers": ^5.7.0"
    ...
  }
}
```

#### CDN distribution as native JS

Optionally, `0xsequence` can be installed as a JS script source (UMD distribution) via:

```js
<script src="https://cdn.ethers.io/lib/ethers-5.7.umd.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/0xsequence@latest/dist/0xsequence.umd.min.js"></script>
```
