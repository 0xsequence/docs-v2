# Marketplaces Overview

Sequence provides a variety of options for your marketplace and in-game store to accelerate your development, namely our **white-label marketplace** as well as our suite of **Marketplace APIs**.

### What are the differences between these options?
The **white-label marketplace** is ideal for getting started with a browser-based marketplace in literally minutes - all with no-coding experience and options to customize the marketplace to fit your branding such as fonts, colors, and logos. Our white-label marketplace is ideal if you want to minimize development time, focus on a web-based experience for your users, and start selling assets.

Conversely, our **Marketplace APIs** give you complete control & customization so you can build your own UI while leaving the complexity of blockchain & backend orchestration to us. Our APIs can be utilized in game engines such as Unity or Unreal to build an in-game marketplace or store. Alternatively, they can be leveraged via a web-based experience in the browser as well - the choice is yours.

You can even mix and match these options! For example, launching your own white-label marketplace for selling your initial game assets while building out your game. Then once launched, your in-game store uses the marketplace APIs to showcase these assets and offer new ones - while ensuring a seamless user experience as the user never needs to leave the game.
