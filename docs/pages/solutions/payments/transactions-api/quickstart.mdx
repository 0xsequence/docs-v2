# Transactions API Service

The Sequence Transactions API (or the technical term Relayer service) offers a simple interface for dispatching meta-transactions on Ethereum-compatible networks.

Meta-transactions are the idea of a transaction inside of a transaction. 

The best part: transactions with Sequence Transactions API are compatible with any existing/deployed Ethereum contract, and thus, integrating the Sequence Transactions API doesn't require any changes to your contracts or dapp. 

The only cavet is that the `msg.sender` is one of the Sequence Relayer addresses.

## Quickstart

### Try your own Deployable Template 

::::steps
#### Access Railway Template

Try out the Transactions API with [your own deployed template](https://railway.app/template/ERJVm2)

#### Google Key Management Serice Cloud Management
Google Key Management Service (KMS) is a cloud service provided by Google Cloud that enables you to manage cryptographic keys for your cloud services in a secure and compliant manner. 

##### 1. Create an Account & Project in the [Google Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)

The project ID you create should be used for `GOOGLE_KMS_PROJECT`.

##### 2. Download Google CLI Locally
Follow the walkthrough on Google's site to install the cli locally to create EVM access keys [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

##### 3. Login to the Developer Console Locally 

```shell
gcloud auth application-default login
```

##### 4. Enabled API & Billing 

Make sure [Billing is enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#console) and you have Enabled the [Cloud KMS API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudkms.googleapis.com&redirect=https://console.cloud.google.com&_ga=2.21571387.1641992167.1719602769-587765847.1712674892) 

##### 5. Initialize the CLI

```shell
gcloud init
```

##### 6. Create Key Ring 

<Callout type="warning">
Important: This quickstart creates Cloud KMS resources such as key rings and keys. Once created, these resources cannot be deleted. 

For more information, see [Why can't I delete keys or key rings?](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/faq#cannot_delete)
</Callout>

The following creates a key ring called `test` where it's available globally:

```shell
gcloud kms keyrings create "test" \
    --location "global"
```

What you put for `"test"` should be used for `GOOGLE_KMS_KEY_RING`.

What you put for `--location` should be used for `GOOGLE_KMS_LOCATION`.

##### 7. Create Signing Key in Cloud
Using the previous parameters key ring and create a Hardware Security Module (HSM) asymmetric-signing key called `"evm_key"` or (something different) of the EVM based Elliptic Curve.

```shell
gcloud kms keys create "evm_key"     \ 
    --location "global" \
    --keyring "test" \     
    --purpose "asymmetric-signing" \     
    --default-algorithm "ec-sign-secp256k1-sha256" \     
    --protection-level "hsm"
```

What you replace `"evm_key"` with should be used for `GOOGLE_KMS_CRYPTO_KEY`.

#### Sequence Builder Project Management

Create a project using this [walkthrough](/solutions/builder/getting-started).

What network you assign to the project should be used for `CHAIN_HANDLE`. 

See [Chain Support](/solutions/technical-references/chain-support). 

#### Access Key Management

Obtain a Project Access Key using this [walkthrough](/solutions/builder/getting-started#claim-an-api-access-key).

This should be used for `PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY`.

#### Deploy an ERC1155 or ERC721 Collectible Contract

Deploy a collectible contract by following this [walkthrough](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-an-item-collection).

This contract should be used for `COLLECTIBLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

#### Complete Railway Template Variables
Use all the values from the previous steps to complete and deploy the online template with the `Deploy` button.

#### Update Exposed Port in Interface
Access settings for your deployment and update the exposed port to `3000`:

##### Generate Domain
![update exposed port](/img/payments/transactions_api_service_deployed_generate_domain.png)

##### Set Port
![update exposed port](/img/payments/transactions_api_service_deployed_set_port_generate_domain.png)

#### Clone the Frontend Template

Clone the [following template](https://github.com/moskalyk/nodejs-transactions-api/tree/master) and update the [`SERVER_URL`](https://github.com/moskalyk/nodejs-transactions-api/blob/master/client/src/App.tsx#L8) with your deployed template url.

Finally, sign in and mint!

<Callout type='info'>
The backend Transactions API template will only accept requests from `http://localhost:5173`.
