# Transactions API Service

The Sequence Transactions API (or the technical term Relayer service) offers a simple interface for dispatching meta-transactions on Ethereum-compatible networks.

Meta-transactions are the idea of a transaction inside of a transaction. 

The best part: transactions with Sequence Transactions API are compatible with any existing/deployed Ethereum contract, and thus, integrating the Sequence Transactions API doesn't require any changes to your contracts or dapp. 

The only cavet is that the `msg.sender` is one of the Sequence Relayer addresses.

## Quickstart

### Try your own Deployable Template 

::::steps
#### Access Railway Template

:::info
Try out the Transactions API with [your own deployed template](https://railway.app/template/ERJVm2)
:::

#### Google Key Management Serice Cloud Management

##### 1. Create an account in the [Google Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)
##### 2. Download Google CLI locally
Follow the walkthrough on Google's site to install the cli locally to create EVM access keys [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

##### 3. Login to the developer Console locally 

```shell
gcloud auth application-default login
```

##### 4. Create Key Ring 

The following creates a key ring called `test` where it's available globally:

```shell
gcloud kms keyrings create "test" \
    --location "global"
```

##### 5. Create Signing Key in Cloud
Using the previous parameters key ring, and creating a Hardware Security Module (HSM) asymmetric-signing key of the EVM based Elliptic Curve

```shell
gcloud kms keys create evm_key     \ 
    --location "global" \
    --keyring "test" \     
    --purpose "asymmetric-signing" \     
    --default-algorithm "ec-sign-secp256k1-sha256" \     
    --protection-level "hsm"
```

#### Sequence Builder Project Management

Create a project using this [walkthrough](/solutions/builder/getting-started).

#### Access Key Management

Obtain a Project Access Key using this [walkthrough](/solutions/builder/getting-started#claim-an-api-access-key).

#### Deploy an ERC1155 or ERC721 Collectible Contract

Deploy a collectible contract by following this [walkthrough](/solutions/collectibles/contracts/deploy-an-item-collection).

#### Complete Railway Template Variables
Use all the values from the previous steps to complete and deploy the online template.

#### Update Exposed Port in Interface
Access settings for your deployment update the exposed port to `3000`:

##### Generate Domain
![update exposed port](/img/payments/transactions_api_service_deployed_generate_domain.png)

##### Set Port
![update exposed port](/img/payments/transactions_api_service_deployed_set_port_generate_domain.png)

#### Clone the Frontend Template

Clone the [following template](https://github.com/moskalyk/nodejs-transactions-api/tree/master) and update the [`SERVER_URL`](https://github.com/moskalyk/nodejs-transactions-api/blob/master/client/src/App.tsx#L8) with your deployed template url.

Finally, sign in and mint!
