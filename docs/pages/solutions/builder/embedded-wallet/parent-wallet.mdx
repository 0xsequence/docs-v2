# Embedded Wallet Parent Wallet



## Why deploying a Parent Wallet will future proof integrations

Parent Wallet for an Embedded Wallet configuration must be deployed on-chain to prevent issues with message signing and increased gas cost during transactions. These Parent Wallets can be deployed from [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build)

The possible states that an Embedded Wallet can be in and their behaviour:

| Scenario      | Prerequisite   | `signMessage` Behaviour|
| ---           | ---            | ---                    |
| None deployed   | Default state | signMessage returns an invalid signature |
| Only parent deployed | Manually deployed from Builder OR upon first ever transaction from any wallet | signMessage returns a valid 6492 signature (very low verification support; use Sequence to validate) |
| Both parent and child deployed | Upon first ever transaction from that specific wallet | signMessage returns a valid 1271 signature (moderate verification support; still recommended to use Sequence to validate) |
